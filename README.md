# Capstone-Project

This project was created to give the user a more responsive design with different screen sizes, from mobile version to desktop version, it contains a Home page, where you are going to be able to see all the main information, an about page, where you can see the details of the company, and a tickets page, where you are going to be able to choose between some options to buy some products of the company.

In this case, I tried to follow all the guidelines given, including typographies, icons, and layout.
